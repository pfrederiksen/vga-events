# Disable specific queries for legacy migration code
# The go/weak-sensitive-data-hashing query is disabled because:
# - legacySalt() in crypto.go uses SHA256 intentionally for backward compatibility
# - Only used for decrypting data encrypted with old salt method
# - New encryptions use secure fixedSalt instead
# - Passphrase still protected by PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
# - Function will be removed after migration period
